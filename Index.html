        <p id="tribute-info"> <b>My Dad's most admirable attributes in my eyes:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>He was honest regardless of how difficult it was to tell the truth.</li>
            <li>He always tried to do the right thing because he believed if he did right for other people then other people would do right for him</li>
            <li>He was very kind hearted and loving. There is nothing my kids nor I could do to change the love he had for us. He exhibited actual unconditional love.</li>
            <li>He was a very loyal person to himself as well as others,</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p id="life of">
            Monty was an amazing man who loved his family with a love that you don’t see everyday.  He was a dedicated hard worker who worked his entire life in construction to provide a good life for his family. He traveled all over the US for work which he loved in the summer when his family could join him but winters were lonely and difficult for him. I’m proud to call him my dad. I could call him day or night and he was always ready to do anything he could to help me. He worked in Rifle and everyday on his drive home he would call me and we would talk the whole drive home. He is the only person in my life that I’ve never questioned his love and always knew he would be there for me. He adored his grandkids too as they did him. He was such an integral everyday part of our lives. Although losing him was terribly difficult I have realized he will forever be with me. I can still hear him telling me the things he told me my whole life. Sometimes I will be getting ready to do something and I’ll head his voice saying “Now what would you go and do that for kiddo”? He said that a lot over the years because he didn’t always understand or agree with my decisions. There are so many things I heard him say so many times trying to expand my thinking and teach me things and now that he’s gone his words of wisdom still come to me quite frequently like he is still guiding me through the world. He wanted to leave a positive mark on the world and he stuck to his values and morals and did what was right every day in hopes he could leave this world a better place than when he found it. Not a day goes by that I don’t miss him, I even miss the lectures he would give me when he would see me making a decision which he didn’t feel was the best one I could make. The world lost a truly amazing man the day he died but Heaven gained an amazing angel and I know he is looking down on us and guiding us through our life.
